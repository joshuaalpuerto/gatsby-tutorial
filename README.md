# Gatsby Tutorial

## Why

We would like to explore creating application using gatsby.

## Quick start
Make sure you have nvm, node v8 up, and yarn installed before proceeding with the following steps. Also, ensure :

1. Clone repo - `git clone git@github.com:joshuaalpuerto/gatsby-tutorial.git`
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
3. Run `yarn develop` to see the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
